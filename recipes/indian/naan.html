        <li>In another bowl, combine all-purpose flour, salt, yogurt, and the activated yeast mixture. Knead into a soft dough. Cover and let it rise for about 1-2 hours in a warm place.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to its highest temperature (usually around 500°F or 260°C) or use a pizza stone or cast-iron skillet in the oven while preheating.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into equal portions and roll them into ovals or rounds about ¼ inch thick.</li>
        <li>If desired, sprinkle minced garlic and chopped coriander leaves on top of the naan and gently press them into the dough.</li>
        <li>Place the naan on a baking sheet or directly on the preheated pizza stone/skillet. Bake in the oven for 2-3 minutes or until puffed up and lightly browned.</li>
