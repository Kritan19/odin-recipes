    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Arborio rice: 1 ½ cups</li>
        <li>Chicken or vegetable broth: 4 cups</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter: 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Olive oil: 1 tablespoon</li>
        <li>Finely chopped onion: ½ cup</li>
        <li>Minced garlic cloves: 2</li>
        <li>Dry white wine: ½ cup (optional)</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese: ½ cup</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped: 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Method:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, heat the chicken or vegetable broth over low heat and keep it warm.</li>
        <li>In a separate large pan or pot, heat butter and olive oil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add finely chopped onion and minced garlic. Sauté until the onion becomes translucent.</li>
        <li>Add Arborio rice to the pan and stir continuously for about 2-3 minutes until the rice grains are well coated and slightly translucent.</li>
        <li>If using, pour in the white wine and stir until it is absorbed by the rice.</li>
        <li>Begin adding the warm broth to the rice, one ladleful at a time, stirring continuously. Allow the liquid to be absorbed before adding the next ladleful. Continue this process until the rice is creamy and cooked al dente, usually around 18-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from heat. Stir in grated Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan and let the risotto rest for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve the risotto hot, garnished with additional grated Parmesan cheese and parsley if desired.</li>
      </ol>
