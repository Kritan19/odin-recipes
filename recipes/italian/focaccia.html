        <li>All-purpose flour: 4 cups</li>
        <li>Warm water: 1 ½ cups</li>
        <li>Active dry yeast: 2 ¼ teaspoons</li>
        <li>Granulated sugar: 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Olive oil: ½ cup (divided)</li>
        <li>Salt: 1 ½ teaspoons</li>
        <li>Herbs and toppings (rosemary, thyme, olives, cherry tomatoes, etc.): as desired</li>
        <li>Sea salt for sprinkling</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Method:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and 1/4 cup of olive oil.</li>
        <li>Pour the yeast mixture into the flour mixture and stir until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Grease a baking sheet or line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Punch down the risen dough and transfer it to the prepared baking sheet. Gently stretch and press the dough to cover the sheet.</li>
        <li>Using your fingers, make dimples all over the dough. Drizzle the remaining olive oil over the dough.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle herbs, toppings, and sea salt over the dough as desired.</li>
        <li>Let the dough rest for 15-20 minutes, then bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove the focaccia from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
      </ol>
