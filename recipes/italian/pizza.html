    <h2>Method:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C).</li>
        <li>In a bowl, dissolve sugar in warm water. Sprinkle yeast over the water and let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.</li>
        <li>In a separate large bowl, mix flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
        <li>Mix until the dough comes together, then knead on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Form the dough into a ball, place it in a greased bowl, cover with a kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and roll it out into a circle or rectangle on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled dough onto a pizza stone or baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Spread pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
        <li>Top with shredded mozzarella cheese and your choice of vegetables, meats, or additional toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and melted.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, sprinkle with fresh basil leaves (if using), slice, and serve hot.</li>
      </ol>
