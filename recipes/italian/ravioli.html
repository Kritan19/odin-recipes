        <li>All-purpose flour: 2 cups</li>
        <li>Eggs: 2</li>
        <li>Olive oil: 1 tablespoon</li>
        <li>Salt: ½ teaspoon</li>
        <li>Water (if needed)</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients for Filling:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Ricotta cheese: 1 cup</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese: ½ cup</li>
        <li>Chopped fresh spinach: 1 cup</li>
        <li>Egg: 1</li>
        <li>Garlic powder: ½ teaspoon</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Method:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>To make the pasta dough, mound the flour on a clean surface and make a well in the center. Add eggs, olive oil, and salt into the well.</li>
        <li>Slowly incorporate the flour into the wet ingredients using a fork or your hands until a dough forms. If the dough is too dry, add water, a tablespoon at a time, until it comes together.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough for about 8-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.</li>
        <li>While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. In a bowl, mix together ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, chopped spinach, egg, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper until well combined. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Divide the rested dough into smaller portions. Roll out one portion of the dough into a thin sheet using a rolling pin or pasta machine.</li>
        <li>Place small spoonfuls of the filling on the dough sheet, leaving space between each spoonful.</li>
        <li>Place another sheet of dough over the filling and press around the edges of each ravioli to seal them.</li>
        <li>Use a knife or ravioli cutter to cut the individual ravioli.</li>
        <li>Cook the ravioli in boiling salted water for about 3-4 minutes until they float to the surface.</li>
        <li>Remove the cooked ravioli with a slotted spoon and serve with your favorite sauce and garnish with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh herbs if desired.</li>
      </ol>
