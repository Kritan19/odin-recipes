      <ol>
        <li>Heat a cup of water and chaku in pan at a medium heat</li>
        <li>When chaku melts, add sesame powder, coconut powder and cardamom powder and stir it gently.</li>
        <li>Add about a spoon full of rice flour and stir it gently</li>
        <li>When the paste is good (not too thick or too thin) pour it into a bowl</li>
        <li>Make the dough for yomari using rice flour and Luke warm water</li>
        <li>Make a soft dough (dough should be soft because if the dough is hard the yomari will break)</li>
        <li>When the dough is ready cover it with soft piece of cloth and leave it for about half an hour.</li>
      </ol>
    <h3>After half an hour</h3>
      <ol>
      <li>Grease your palm with cooking oil so that the dough will not stick to your hand</li>
      <li>Take a small piece of dough and make it first into round then into long yomari shape</li>
      <li>Make as thin as you can because more thin your wrap is more tasty yomari becomes</li>
      <li>Add two teaspoon of chhaku into the wrap and slowly close the yomori top.</li>
      <li>You should keep on roiling the yomari while closing the top.</li>
      <li>Heat the water in the steamer.</li>
      <li>When water boils, put yomari in steamer and let it steam for about 10 minutes.</li>
